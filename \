#### [](#header-4)Model, Simplify and Understand

Intelligent systems are increasingly stepping into our lives. The interaction between humans and machines is going to be important.  We need to ensure that algorithms can explain their rationale to us. We do not remember every image or scene we encounter through our life.  We carry forward a compressed version of life in our heads.  Mimicing that learning process is what fascinates me.  
This maps into a number of specific algorithms such as maintenance of knowledge representation in streaming fashion, development of scalable searching and inference algorithms, high-fidelity simulation of the knowledge representations themselves. 
We work on a number of really exciting application domains at the intersection of these research capabilities. 
We work on designing systems that continuously learns from incoming data, and uses the extracted knowledge to recommend actions. 


Following are some areas of my work.

#### [](#header-2) Knowledge Graphs
The ability to construct domain specific knowledge graphs is critical to drive needs for question-answering or hypothesis generation. Despite their value, automated construction of knowledge graphs remains an expensive technical challenge that is beyond the reach for most enterprises and academic institutions. We propose an end-to-end framework for developing custom knowledge graph driven analytics for arbitrary application domains.

#### [StreamingDataAnalytics](#header-1) Streaming Algorithms
StreamWorks is a graph analytics system designed to detect patterns from massive data streams. This video shows a demonstration of StreamWorks's capability to detect exfiltration events from a network traffic flow data stream. StreamWorks was selected by US Department of Homeland Security as the 2017 graduate of its [Transition-To-Practice program](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/csd-ttp).
