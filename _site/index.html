<h2 id="-knowledge-graphs"><a href="#header-2"></a> Knowledge Graphs</h2>
<p>The ability to construct domain specific knowledge graphs is critical to drive needs for question-answering or hypothesis generation. Despite their value, automated construction of knowledge graphs remains an expensive technical challenge that is beyond the reach for most enterprises and academic institutions. We propose an end-to-end framework for developing custom knowledge graph driven analytics for arbitrary application domains.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Please check out <a href="https://github.com/streaming-graphs/NOUS">NOUS</a>, our open source knowledge graph framework.</li>
  <li>Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02314.pdf">short paper in Data Engineering meets the Semantic Web, at ICDE 2017</a> shows how a generic knowledge graph system can answer complex application queries by reading the web</li>
  <li>Data quality is a major issue for automated knowledge graph construction. See our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.03778">paper in 2016 SDM Workshop</a> for estimating confidence in triples via Bayesian Personalized Ranking</li>
  <li>Discovering frequent patterns in the data is critical for sensemaking. See our paper in 2014 KDD Workshop for <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v36/ray14.pdf">Learning frequent patterns from graph streams</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-streaming-algorithms"><a href="#header-1"></a> Streaming Algorithms</h2>
<p>StreamWorks is a graph analytics system designed to detect patterns from massive data streams. This video shows a demonstration of StreamWorks’s capability to detect exfiltration events from a network traffic flow data stream. StreamWorks was selected by US Department of Homeland Security as the 2017 graduate of its <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/csd-ttp">Transition-To-Practice program</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check out our <a href="https://openproceedings.org/2015/conf/edbt/paper-307.pdf">EDBT paper</a> on detecting patterns from dynamic graph datastreams via subgraph isomorphism.</li>
  <li>If you are interested in exploring graph querying for cyber-security applications, see our <a href="publications/2013_grades.pdf">SIGMOD workshop paper</a>.</li>
  <li>The entire pipeline is described in our <a href="publications/2013_sigmod_demo.pdf">SIGMOD demonstrations paper</a>.</li>
  <li>Not streaming, but this <a href="publications/2014_parasol.pdf">SIGMOD workshop paper</a> explores the issues around querying cross-cloud databases.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-autonomous-systems-design"><a href="#header-1"></a> Autonomous Systems Design</h2>
<p>Resilience is the ability of a system to continue to function, even in a degraded manner, in the face of impediments that affect the proper operation of some of its components. For a cyber-network impediments can be randomly occurring failures of software services or hardware systems in an enterprise, or it may be unavailability of services or systems as the consequence of a cyber attack.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We published this <a href="publications/2016_icassp.pdf">really cool paper in ICASSP 2016</a> showing how graph models and their metrics provide a simple, yet powerful tool to discover diverse types of network intrusions.</li>
  <li>Our paper at <a href="publications/2015_safeconfig.pdf">2015 Automated Decision Making for Active Cyber Defense</a> presenting algorithms to alter a network itself to adapt to an attack</li>
  <li>Our <a href="publications/2015_acm_ccs_demo.pdf">paper</a> at 2015 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security showing a live demonstration of cyber resilience in Amazon Cloud</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-sensor-networks"><a href="#header-1"></a> Sensor Networks</h2>
<p>In my prior life I had implemented a sensor network protocol named <a href="https://s.campbellsci.com/documents/cn/manuals/pakbusnetguide.pdf">PakBus</a>. Developed by Campbell Scientific, PakBus is universally used by data collection devices. Our open-source version of a C++/Linux version of PakBus is available <a href="https://github.com/sutanay/PbCdlComm">here</a>.</p>
